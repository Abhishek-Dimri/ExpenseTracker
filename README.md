### **1. Define Core Features**  
What functionalities do you want in your expense tracker? Here are some essential ones:  
- **User Authentication:** Signup/Login (JWT authentication)  
- **Expense Management:** Add, edit, delete expenses  
- **Category Management:** Categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Bills, etc.)  
- **Income Management:** Track income sources  
- **Expense Reports:** View total expenses per category, monthly summaries  
- **Search & Filters:** Filter by date, category, amount  
- **Dashboard:** Graphs & charts to visualize spending patterns  

### **2. Plan the Tech Stack**  
Since you're using MERN:  
- **Frontend:** React + Redux (for state management)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (for storing expenses & user data)  
- **Authentication:** JWT for securing user data  

### **3. Database Schema**  
Weâ€™ll need at least these collections:  
1. **User Model** (name, email, password, createdAt)  
2. **Expense Model** (amount, category, date, description, userId)  
3. **Income Model** (amount, source, date, userId)  

### **4. API Routes Planning**  
| **Route**        | **Method** | **Functionality** |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| /auth/signup     | POST      | Register a new user |
| /auth/login      | POST      | Authenticate user |
| /expenses        | GET       | Fetch all expenses |
| /expenses        | POST      | Add a new expense |
| /expenses/:id    | PUT       | Update an expense |
| /expenses/:id    | DELETE    | Delete an expense |
| /income         | GET       | Fetch all incomes |
| /income         | POST      | Add new income |
| /income/:id     | PUT       | Update income |
| /income/:id     | DELETE    | Delete income |

### **5. Frontend Structure**  
- **Pages**:  
  - Login, Signup  
  - Dashboard (expenses, income, charts)  
  - Add Expense, Edit Expense  
  - Reports (monthly/yearly summaries)  

- **Components**:  
  - Expense List  
  - Expense Form  
  - Income List  
  - Charts (using Chart.js or Recharts)  

### **6. User Flow**  
1. User registers and logs in  
2. Adds expenses & income  
3. Views summary on dashboard  
4. Uses filters to analyze spending  
5. Updates/deletes records as needed
